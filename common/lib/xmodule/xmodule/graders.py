    A course grader takes the totaled scores for each graded section (that a student has
    started) in the course. From these scores, the grader calculates an overall percentage
    grade. The grader should also generate information about how that score was calculated,
    to be displayed in graphs or charts.

    A grader has one required method, grade(), which is passed a grade_sheet. The grade_sheet
    contains scores for all graded section that the student has started. If a student has
    a score of 0 for that section, it may be missing from the grade_sheet. The grade_sheet
    is keyed by section format. Each value is a list of Score namedtuples for each section
    that has the matching section format.

    The grader outputs a dictionary with the following keys:
    - percent: Contains a float value, which is the final percentage score for the student.
    - section_breakdown: This is a list of dictionaries which provide details on sections
    that were graded. These are used for display in a graph or chart. The format for a
    section_breakdown dictionary is explained below.
    - grade_breakdown: This is a list of dictionaries which provide details on the contributions
    of the final percentage grade. This is a higher level breakdown, for when the grade is constructed
    of a few very large sections (such as Homeworks, Labs, a Midterm, and a Final). The format for
    a grade_breakdown is explained below. This section is optional.

    A dictionary in the section_breakdown list has the following keys:
    percent: A float percentage for the section.
    label: A short string identifying the section. Preferably fixed-length. E.g. "HW  3".
    detail: A string explanation of the score. E.g. "Homework 1 - Ohms Law - 83% (5/6)"
    category: A string identifying the category. Items with the same category are grouped together
    in the display (for example, by color).
    prominent: A boolean value indicating that this section should be displayed as more prominent
    than other items.

    A dictionary in the grade_breakdown list has the following keys:
    percent: A float percentage in the breakdown. All percents should add up to the final percentage.
    detail: A string explanation of this breakdown. E.g. "Homework - 10% of a possible 15%"
    category: A string identifying the category. Items with the same category are grouped together
    in the display (for example, by color).
