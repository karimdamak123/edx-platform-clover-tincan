    A higher order function implemented on top of the

    structure for the given user starting at starting_block_usage_key.

    Arguments:
        user (django.contrib.auth.models.User) - User object for
            which the block structure is to be transformed.

        starting_block_usage_key (UsageKey) - Specifies the starting block
            of the block structure that is to be transformed.

        transformers (BlockStructureTransformers) - A collection of
            transformers whose transform methods are to be called.
            If None, COURSE_BLOCK_ACCESS_TRANSFORMERS is used.

        BlockStructureBlockData - A transformed block structure,
            starting at starting_block_usage_key, that has undergone the
            transform methods for the given user and the course
            associated with the block structure.  If using the default
