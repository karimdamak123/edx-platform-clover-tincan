EdX Developer's Guide
######################

We have moved the edX Developer's Guide to the `edx-documentation`_ repository
as of January 13, 2015.

By moving documentation to its own repository, we will be better able to
develop workflows, manage versioning, create translations, and automate
testing, without complicating ongoing development of the edX Platform.

.. _edx_documentation: https://github.com/edx/edx-documentation

******************************
EdX Platform Docstrings
******************************

We are in the process of creating a new project to publish docstrings for the
edX Platform. Docstrings will be included for CMS, LMS, and Common modules.

This project will remain in the edX Platform repository, in the docs/en-us
directory.

******************************
View Published Documentation
******************************

EdX documentation is published through Read the Docs. Links to all published
documentation are available through `docs.edx.org`_.

We welcome input from the community on any documentation issues.  You can
